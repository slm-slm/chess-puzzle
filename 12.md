- Consider a game board consisting of 4 rows and 3 columns.
- The game is played with 3 black knight and 3 white knight chess pieces.
- Initially, the 3 black knights are placed in the top row, while the 3 white knights are placed in the bottom row.
- The goal of the game is to swap the pieces on the board, i.e., to get the white knights in the top row, and to get the black knights in the bottom row, respectively. The pieces move according to the rules of the chess.
- A piece is not allowed to be moved to a square that is under attack by any piece of the opposite color.
- Black pieces and white pieces move in turn (white moves first).



- When a new game is started the program must ask for the name of the player.



- The program must store the result of the games as follows.
- For each game, the following information must be stored: the date and time when the game was started/finished, the name of the player, the number of moves made by the player during the game, and the outcome (the puzzle is solved/given up).
- The program must show a high score table in which the top 10 results are displayed.
- You can score the players based on the steps/time required to solve the puzzle.



- The program must store data in a database, in a JSON file, or in an XML document. Optionally, you can implement load/save game functionality.
